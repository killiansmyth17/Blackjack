# Blackjack

An exercise on OOD principles for personal Java practice

## To-do (probably):

- Create a deck class with operations for shuffling, dealing, etc
- Create a hand class with operations for [research card game operations for hand]
- Create Blackjack class for the game itself (will probably contain instances of deck, hand, etc) [Requires some more planning]
