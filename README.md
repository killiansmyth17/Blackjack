# Blackjack

An exercise on OOD principles for personal Java practice

## Complete:
- Created Card class that uses enums for Rank and Suit. Each Rank contains a label/value pair (e.g. "Queen", 12)
- Created Deck class with operations for shuffling, drawing, getters/setters, etc
- Created Blackjack class, currently being used to test classes

## To-do:
- Create interface/parent class (need decide on this after research) for a "stack" of cards
- Create Hand class with similar operations to Deck, main difference being the constructor
- Create Blackjack game itself in Blackjack class
